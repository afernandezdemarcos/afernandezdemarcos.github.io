Welcome to my site! I am a PhD student in Statistics at Carlos III University of Madrid since I started it part-time in 2021. After three years of simoultaneously teaching mathematics to high-school students, on October 2024 I switched to full-time working on my PhD dissertation.

You can find out more about me professionally [here](/resume).
